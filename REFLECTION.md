# Reflection

## What did you find most challenging about this practical?
I found integrating the Wikipedia API with Flask the most challenging, especially handling different types of errors and ensuring the web application returned appropriate responses.

## What did you learn from completing this practical?
I learned how to use Flask to build a simple web application and integrate it with an external API. I also gained experience in handling exceptions and using Flask's routing and template rendering.

## How would you improve your code or approach if you had more time?
I would enhance the web application by adding more features, such as user authentication, or improving the UI with CSS. I would also refactor the code to follow better design patterns and handle additional edge cases.
